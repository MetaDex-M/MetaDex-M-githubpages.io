### Welcome to Meta-(M)-DEX

## Intro
Meta (M) is a decentralized exchange running on Binance Smart Chain and Pancake swap, with lots of other features that let you earn and win tokens.
What we are doing is creating a perpetual deflation system, the (M) Token allows a constant price pump with a sufficient burn mechanism. We are not trying to replace the swap & exchange but to add value into the system and create a suitable and sustainable environment for people to yield farm with safe and high returns.


## Features
Unique burning mechanism
We are trying to create a strong burning mechanism that increases the token price constantly
2% burn fee will be charged at staking once staking pools open
We hope to create a smooth and valuable experience for all! Earn M, and other coins (to be determined) while staking.

## Security
- Removed migrator code (inherited from Pancake swap)
- We can`t Rugpull you!!

## Launch Details

1. Starting 29 April 2022 we will open the sale of tokens on our Dex. 
2. Every day the yield % will go up by 1% for 15 days till we reached a 15X
3. You have to stake BNB and M pair and commit it to the yield farm.
4. Extra rewards will be handed out for stakeholders that stay the 15 day period.
5. Token opening price is 0.025 cents.
6. Total Supply for launch 160 000 M Tokens
7. The Entire distrubution system is in the Hands of the MasterChef contract.
8. Once the eco system is established full controll will be handed over to the Governance system.

## Why Ticker (M)

The main aim is to bring all MetaVerse related projects to our eco-system. We want to create a umbrella for the Verse.
Listing solid projects on our platform easly for the entire industry to grow.
We have lots of plans like listing on major exchanges and so on but all that will form part of our roadmap to come.

## Why should you trust us.
Personaly I have been in the space since 2017 If you head over to our twitter page you will see it was launched some years back.
Binance made it truely possible to create a project like ours. Personally I suffered losses from yieldfarms and coins that pump and dump.
We will do our best to control the flow and % so everyone feel they had a fair start.
The opening hype causes hysteria and people cant buy quick enough and the price increases and increases untill the wales dump out. You are left out of pocket and holding for dear life hoping the project really goes somewhere.

We are planning to build an entire brand behind the project. So atleat 1 big event will happen every month.
Be part of the MetaVerse --- WE ARE M
