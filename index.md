# Welcome to Meta-(M)-DEX

## Intro
Meta (M) is a decentralized exchange running on Binance Smart Chain and Pancake swap, with lots of other features build in.
What we are doing is creating a perpetual deflation system, the (M) Token allows a constant price increase with a sufficient burn mechanism. We are not trying to replace the Dex`s but to add value into the system and create a suitable and sustainable environment for people to yield farm with safe and high returns.


## Features
Unique burning mechanism
We are trying to create a strong burning mechanism that increases the token price constantly
2% burn fee will be charged at staking once staking pools open.
We hope to create a smooth and valuable experience for all! Earn M, and other coins (to be determined) while staking.

## Security
- Removed migrator code (inherited from Pancake swap)
- We can`t Rug pull you!!

## Launch Details

1. Starting 29 April 2022 we will open the sale of tokens on our Dex. 
2. Every day the yield % will go up by 1% for 15 days till we reached a 15X
3. You have to stake BNB and M pair and commit it to the yield farm.
4. Extra rewards will be handed out for stakeholders that stay the 15-day period.
5. Token opening price is 0.025 cents.
6. Total Supply for launch 160 000 M Tokens
7. The Entire distribution system is in the Hands of the MasterChef contract.
8. Once the eco system is established full control will be handed over to the Governance system.

## Why Ticker (M)

The main aim is to bring all MetaVerse related projects to our eco-system. We want to create an umbrella for the Verse.
Listing solid projects on our platform easily for the entire industry to grow.
We have lots of plans like listing on major exchanges and so on but all that will form part of our roadmap to come.

## Why should you trust us.
Personally I have been in the space since 2017. If you head over to our twitter page you will see it was launched some years back.
Binance made it truly possible to create a project like ours. Personally I suffered losses from yield farms and coins that pump and dump.
We will do our best to control the flow and % so everyone feel they had a fair start.

The opening hype causes hysteria and people can’t buy quick enough and the price increases and increases until the wales dump out. You are left out of pocket and holding for dear life hoping the project really goes somewhere.
No More I say!! Starting the yield % increase from day 1 every day will give enough time for people to come into the system and prevent that "Buy the Top" scenario.

We are planning to build an entire brand behind the project. So at least 1 big event will happen every month.
