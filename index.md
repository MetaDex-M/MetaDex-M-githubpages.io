### Welcome to Meta-(M)-DEX

## Intro
Meta (M) is a decentralized exchange running on Binance Smart Chain and Pancake swap exchange, with lots of other features that let you earn and win tokens.
What we are doing is creating a perpetual deflation system, the (M) Token allows a constant price pump with a sufficient burn mechanism. We are not trying to replace the swap & exchange but to add value into the system and create a suitable and sustainable environment for people to yield farm with safe and high returns.


## Features
Unique burning mechanism
We are trying to create a strong burning mechanism that increases the token price constantly
2% burn fee will be charged at staking once staking pools open
We hope to create a smooth and valuable experience for all! Earn M, and other coins (to be determined) while staking.

## Security
Removed migrator code (inherited from Pancake swap)

## Launch Details

1. Starting 29 April 2022 we will open the sale of tokens on our Dex. 
2. Every day the yield % will go up for 15 days till we reached a 15X
3. You have to stake BNB and M pair and commit it to the yield farm.
4. Extra rewards will be handed out for stakeholders that stay the 15 day period.
